My name is Tyrannosaurus Rex. I have the following qualities:

- I have VERY short arms
- My hands have two fingers each
- Goats make excellent appetizers
- I eat lawyers
- I can't see you if you don't move
- I don't get along with raptors
- I have island fever
- I like long stomps on the beach

### My story
